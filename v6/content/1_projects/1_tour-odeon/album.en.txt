Text: <p><em>The Odeon Tower marks the return of high-rise construction in the principality. It is a double skyscraper intended for commercial, professional and residential use. The building consists of two wings of 44 and 49 floors, set on a common base, above 10 levels of parking and is currently the tallest tower on the rock, reaching over 170 meters. The tower is known for its high-end finishes, as it houses the most expensive apartment in the world at the time of its commercialization, a penthouse of 3,300 m2.</em></p><p>Prince Rainier III had decided in the 1980s to put an end to the construction of high-rise buildings in Monaco. But the principality could not expand indefinitely, so Prince Albert II decided in 2009 to develop the city vertically. The Odeon Tower is part of this logic.</p><p>Considering its narrow surface area (2 km2), building in Monaco is a major challenge. Its location, on the side of a mountain, requires the mastery of numerous civil engineering techniques. Its limited footprint required numerous foundation calculations.</p><p>Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)</p>
